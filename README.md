## Two-Player Game with Player Name Input

This project is a Qt-based application that implements a two-player game with the following features:

Input dialog for players to provide their names.

Game turn display, showing whose turn it is (Player1 or Player2).

Prevention of starting the game without player names.

Dynamic resizing of game and dialog windows.

Intuitive user interface built with Qt Designer.

## Features

### 1. Player Name Input

A dialog window allows both players to input their names.

Input validation ensures that both names are provided before proceeding.

### 2. Dynamic Turn Display

The application dynamically updates the turn label to indicate "Player1's turn" or "Player2's turn."

### 3. User Interface

Built using Qt Designer for simplicity and customization.

.ui files define the structure of the main window and dialog window.
